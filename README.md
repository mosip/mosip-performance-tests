### High level Approach:
* Simulate load to a particular application to understand the response time behaviour and find the bottlenecks areas
	* Run with 4 replicas of all the dependent services so the bottleneck on the test application is exposed while profiling
* There are 3 types of thread groups
	1. Setup - run once for the prerequesites on a new environment
	2. Prepartion - Run once before execution threadgroup, it could be once per day or everytime before execution thread group
	3. Execution - Actual load test will be performed by this thread group
* There could be multiple setup thread groups based on the context of the setup process
* Each API that is performance tested will have optionally one preparation thread group and will have one execution thread group

### QA Acceptance Criteria:
* Readme document should have sufficient information for someone with Jmeter expertise to run the load testing for a particular module
* All environment specific modification should be done only in the user defined variables
* All preparation thread groups should be able to run in sequence that is required to run execution for 15 min
* All execution thread groups should be able to run in sequence for 15 min each
* Multiple preparation thread groups should be able to run in parallel that is required to run executions for 30 min
* Multiple execution thread groups should be able to run in parallel for 30 min
* The sample count on prepration should be always less than the execution sample count except for the API endpoints readme explictly says otherwise.
* Load can be very less but atleast 3 users should be targeted for execution and preparation thread groups (Unless prepration thread group explictly says in readme that it has to run with single thread)
	
### Contains

    1. Pre-registration (UI and batch Jobs)
    2. Registration Processor
    3. ID Repository
    4. ID Authentication

* Open source Tools used,
    1. [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
    2. [Glowroot](https://glowroot.org/)

### How to run performance scripts using Apache JMeter tool
* Download Apache JMeter from https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
* Download scripts for the required module.
* Start JMeter by running the jmeter.bat file for Windows or jmeter file for Unix. 
* Validate the scripts for one user.
* Execute a dry run for 10 min.
* Execute performance run with various loads in order to achieve targeted NFR's.
