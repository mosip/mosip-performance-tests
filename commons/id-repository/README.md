This folder contains performance test scripts and test data of ID-Repository module.

### Environment Required:-
***Below modules should be running in kubernetes setup***

* Websub
* Kernel notification service
* Kernel audit service
* Kernel authmanager service
* Biosdk service
* All IDrepo services

### Data prequisite:-
* Center & Machine ID details are required for the RID Generation. This values can be updated based on the environment from [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/id-repository/support-files/Center-MachineIDValues.csv).
* Some of the identity variables like firstname, date of birth & gender can be added from [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/id-repository/support-files/addIdentityRequestDetails.csv).
* Some of the identity variables like firstname, date of birth, gender & address can be updated or modified from [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/id-repository/support-files/updateIdentityRequestDetails.csv).

### How to run JMeter scripts:-
* We need to take care of the prerequisites first for which we a helper script [IDRepo_Helper_Script.jmx](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/id-repository/scripts/IDRepo_Helper_Script.jmx).
* The helper script has one thread group for the creation of authorization token which we will further use in our execution.
* All the creation tasks which will happen that will automatically save the tokens created to a file in the bin folder of JMeter which will be used further by our test script for execution.
* For the test execution part we have a script [IDRepo_Test_Script.jmx](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/id-repository/scripts/IDRepo_Test_Script.jmx) which will do all the execution tasks.
* In the test script we have a preparation & execution thread group for all the API's. In preparation group the data preparation part will happen & in the execution group the main test execution will take place.
* The ID Repo module API's which we are considering here are - Retrieve Identity using UIN API, Retrieve Identity using VID API, Add Identity API, Update Identity API,Create VID API, Update VID API, Auth type status API, Create Draft API, Get Draft API, Update Draft API & Publish Draft API.
* All the thread groups will run in a sequential manner & if we don't want to run all of them we can disable the one which we don't want to run.
* Also for viewing the results or output of our test we have added certain listener test elements at the end of our test script which are - View Results Tree, Aggregate Report, Active Threads Over Time graph, Response Times Percentiles graph, Response Times vs Threads graph & Transaction Throughput vs Threads graph.
* We have a test element named 'User Defined Variables' in both the helper & test scripts where the 
  1. server IP
  2. server port
  3. protocol
  4. clientId
  5. secretKey
  6. appId
  7. vidType - (This is specifically used for Create VID API where we can basically set the type of VID we want to use eg: Temporary or Perpetual)
  8. lockStatus - (This is specifically used for Auth type status API where we can basically mention the auth status either it will be locked or unlocked)
  
  ***All these are parameterized & can be changed based on our requirements which will further reflect in the entire script***
